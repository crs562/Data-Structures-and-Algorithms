### Dynamic Connectivity (Union-find)
**Task** : Our goal is to write a program to filter out extraneous pairs from the
			sequence: When the program reads a pair p q from the input, it should
			write the pair to the output only if the pairs it has seen to that point
			do not imply that p is connected to q. If the previous pairs do imply that
			p is connected to q, then the program should ignore the pair p q and proceed
			to read in the next pair. <br/>
**Input** : The input is a sequence of pairs of integers, where each integer
			represens an object of some type and we are to interpret the pair
			p q as meaning p is connected to q. <br/>
**code** : UF.java <br/>

### Dynamic Connectivity (Quick-Find)
**Task** : Determine whether two sites are in the same component. <br/>
**code** : QuickFindUF.java <br/>

### Dynamic Connectivity (Quick-Union)
**code** : QuickUnionUF.java <br/>

### Dynamic Connectivity (Weighted quick-union)
**code** : WeightedQuickUnionUF.java <br/>

### Dynamic Connectivity (Quick-union with path compression)
**Task** : Modify QuickUnionUF.java to include path compression, by adding a loop to
			find() that links every sie on the path from p to the root. Give a sequence
			of input pairs that causes this method to produce a path of length 4.
			Note: the amortized cost per operation for this algorithm is known to be
			logarithmic. <br/>
**code** : QuickUnionPathCompressionUF.java <br/>

### Dynamic Connectivity (Weighted quick-union with path compression)
**Task** : Modify WeightedQuickUnionUF.java to implement path compression. Give a
			sequence of input pairs that causes this method to produce a tree of
			height 4. Note: The amortized cost per operation for this algorithm is
			known to be bounded by a function known as the inverse Arkermann function
			and is less than 5 for any conceivable value of N that arises in practice. <br/>
**code** : WeightedQuickUnionPathCompressionUF.java <br/>

### Dynamic Connectivity (Weighted quick-union by height)
**Task** : Develop a implementation that uses the same basic strategy as weighted
			quick-union but keeps track of tree height and always links the shorter
			tree to the taller one. <br/>
**code** : WeightedQuickUnionByHeightUF.java <br/>

### Random Connections
**Task** : Develop a UF client that takes an integer value N from the command line,
			generate random pairs of integers between 0 and N-1, calling connected()
			to determine if they are connected and then union() if not (as in our
			development client), looping until all sites are connected, and printing
			the number of connections generated. Package your program as a static
			method count() that takes N as argument and returns the number of connections
			and a main() that takes N from the command line, calls count(), and prints
			the returned value. <br/>
